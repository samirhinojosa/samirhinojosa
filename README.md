## Hey there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Samir HINOJOSA
After over one decade of experience in the Software Development Life Cycle â€“ SDLC and Business Process Improvement, I can say my skills include analytical thinking, creative problem solving, software developing, among others, which Iâ€™ve applied in several industries such as Oil and Gas, Telecommunications, Education, etc.

As part of my experience, Iâ€™ve worked in different roles such as Software Developer, Tester, Business and System Analyst, Product Owner and Digital Transformation Consultant.

Currently, I became Data Scientist taking advantage of my experience.
